### everything in *italics* refers to content of your locally cloned GIT CI/CD repository 

### every example bellow should be of course ended with commiting the change :)

---

- **Distribute Powershell module to all clients**
  - copy module folder to *Modules*
- **Distribute Powershell module "Posh-SSH" to just computers "PC-1" and "PC-2"**
  - copy module "Posh-SSH" to *Modules*
  - edit *modulesConfig.ps1* as follows
  ```powershell
  $modulesConfig = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        folderName   = "Posh-SSH" # name of module
        computerName = "PC-1", "PC-2" # name of computer/s (variable from module Variables could be used too)
    }
  ```
- **Distribute folder "Monitoring_Scripts" (with whatever content, for example Powershell script and helper files (PS modules etc)) to computer "SERVER-10" (to default location ie C:\Windows\Scripts)**
  - copy folder to *Custom*
  - edit *customConfig.ps1* as follows
  ```powershell
  $customConfig = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        folderName            = "Monitoring_Scripts"
        computerName          = "SERVER-10"
        customDestinationNTFS = "svc-o365" # if just this account should have read permissions to local folder copy on SERVER-10
    }
  }
  ```
- **Distribute just content of folder "IIS_Config" just to web servers to chosen destination**
  - copy folder to *Custom*
  - edit *customConfig.ps1* as follows
  ```powershell
  $customConfig = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        folderName            = "IIS_Config"
        computerName          = $webServer # variable is defined in Variables module
        copyJustContent       = 1
        customLocalDestination = "C:\WWWroot"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Distribute folder "Photo_sync" to share "\\DOMAIN\DFS\root\scripts" and limit access to it**
  - copy folder to *Custom*
  - edit *customConfig.ps1* as follows
  ```powershell
  $customConfig = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        folderName            = "Photo_sync"
        customShareDestination = "\\DOMAIN\DFS\root\scripts"
        customDestinationNTFS   = "APP-1$", "APP-2$", "domain admins"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Create new Powershell function Get-CurrentLoad and distribute it to all clients**
  - in *scripts2module* in folder *Scripts* create file Get-CurrentLoad.ps1 which should contain function Get-CurrentLoad
  - this will lead to creation of Scripts module, that will contain all functions from folder content and will be distributed on all clients
  - if you want to export function to different module, just create new folder in *scripts2module* and place ps1 files with functions in it
- **Create new Powershell function Repair-OutlookProfile and distribute it to just chosen clients**
  - in *scripts2module* create new folder *SomeNewModule*. Inside it create file Repair-OutlookProfile.ps1 which should contain function Repair-OutlookProfile
  - this will lead to creation of module SomeNewModule (so choose name of folder carefuly), that will contain all functions from folder content
  - edit *modulesConfig.ps1* as follows
  ```powershell
  $modulesConfig = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        folderName   = "SomeNewModule" # name of module
        computerName = "PC-1", "PC-2" # name of computer/s (variable from module Variables could be used too)
    }
  ```
